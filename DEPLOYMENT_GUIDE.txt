# Deployment Guide for Shopify Integration Platform

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
1. Ensure all environment secrets are set on Replit:
   - `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` - Your Shopify store URL
   - `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` - Your Shopify API key
   - `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` - Your Shopify API secret
   - `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your Shopify access token
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL database URL

2. Make sure the application is working locally
   - Test the login functionality
   - Check that product syncing works
   - Verify price tracking is functional

## Deployment Process

### Option 1: Using the Simplified Script (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to deploy the application:

```bash
node deploy.cjs
```

This script:
- Sets the NODE_ENV to production
- Runs the main application
- Provides a health check endpoint at the root URL

### Option 2: Using the Enhanced Script
For more diagnostics and setup validation:

```bash
node fixed-deploy.cjs
```

This script:
- Verifies database connection
- Validates Shopify credentials
- Adds any missing database columns
- Sets up proper routing

### Option 3: Using the Original Replit Script
If you need compatibility with Replit's deployment system:

```bash
node replit-deploy.cjs
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Health Check**
   - Visit the root URL (e.g., https://modzmartsuite.replit.app/)
   - You should see a JSON response: `{"status":"healthy","message":"Shopify Integration Service is running","timestamp":"..."}`
   - Or you'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard if using a browser

2. **Application Access**
   - The main application is available at:
     - /dashboard - Main dashboard 
     - /login - Login page
     - /products - Products page

3. **Login Credentials**
   - Username: Admin
   - Password: Ttiinnyy1

## Troubleshooting

### Module System Issues
If you see errors about `require is not defined in ES module scope`:
- Use the .cjs extension for CommonJS files (e.g., deploy.cjs instead of deploy.js)
- Our project uses ES modules by default (type: "module" in package.json)

### API Connection Issues
If you're having issues with the Shopify API:
- Make sure the `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` environment variable matches your Shopify admin access token
- If you're using a different variable name, set both `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` and `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` to the same value

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors:
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Make sure the database schema is up to date by running: `node fix-database-on-replit.cjs`

### Replit-Specific Issues
If you encounter issues specific to Replit:
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies
- Check the console for errors
- Verify that the application server is running
- Check that the health check endpoint is responding

## Production Maintenance

### Updating the Application
When making updates:
1. Make your changes
2. Test locally
3. Deploy using one of the scripts above
4. Verify the deployment

### Database Backups
To backup your database:
```bash
node export-data.cjs
```

To restore from a backup:
```bash
node import-data.cjs
```
